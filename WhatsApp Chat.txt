“Slow and steady wins the race” does not apply to AI models. An AI compiler's configurations can change the way it compiles and optimizes the models, making them run faster—or slower.

In this competition, you’ll predict how fast an AI model runs and determine the best configuration for each model.

Total Prizes:
$50,000
 
Entry Deadline:
November 10, 2023

https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-ai-model-runtime?utm_medium=email&utm_source=gamma&utm_campaign=comp-tpugraphs-2023


Your work will improve the compiler's heuristic to select the best configuration without human intervention. You’ll help AI models run more efficiently, and consume less time and resources overall.

Good luck,

AICTE Approved institutions

Greetings from AICTE !

As you are already aware that Yuva Sangam is a flagship program of the Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat (EBSB) initiative, launched by the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India. This initiative focuses on conducting exposure tours of the youths comprising mainly students studying in Higher Educational institutions (HEIs) & some off-campus youths from one state to other states & vice versa. It provides an immersive experience of various facets of life, development landmarks, recent achievements and a youth connect in the host state. The program aims to promote national integration and understanding by connecting youth from different parts of the country through educational and cultural exchanges.

In addition to the cultural exchange, Yuva Sangam also includes a number of other activities that are designed to help students develop their leadership, sports and soft skills. For example, students may get an opportunity not only to participate in workshops on leadership, communication, and teamwork but also sports events that may be organised by SAI. They will also have the opportunity to meet and interact with VVIPs, celebrities or important personalities of the host state.

The success of earlier phases of Yuva Sangam are a testament to the importance of investing in youth and building bridges between different communities. The program has had a positive impact on the lives of thousands of youth and has helped to build a more united and inclusive India.

I request your support in motivating students of your institution to register for Yuva Sangam Phase-4, a student exchange program under EBSB. 

All interested students can register online at https://ebsb.aicte-india.org/

The registration has started on 25-01-2024 and the last date is 04-02-2024.

Please find attached a document on how to inspire students to register for Yuva Sangam.

16/03/24, 9:38 pm - R Raja Course Cordinator: Dear Students
It is found that many students are doing malpractice during Code Chef Contests for getting star ratings. 
Copying the code with variable changes will not gain any knowledge for you. 
I hope many are doing this just because of credits and not for gaining skills for high package placements. 

We are going to hold code chef credits and the same will be considered after offline contests to be conducted separately by Code Chef for KARE students.
16/03/24, 9:39 pm - R Raja Course Cordinator: Don't do malpractice during public contests and get your reputation spoiled.

In the last three years, significant time and effort have been invested by AI4Bharat in building the IndicVoice database of reasonable size. Now, we are seeking your contribution to scale the size of the IndicVoices database. We request a fraction of your time for recording your voice in your native language. 

Please visit the following link: https://ai4bharat.iitm.ac.in/kathbath/ and follow the instructions provided. We appreciate your contribution by issuing a certificate if you have contributed more than 5 minutes of recording. Your participation serves the nation. Kindly share this request with all students

The global Internet has begun a formidable migration to NIST PQC methods. Unfortunately, two of NIST's nine initial standardization candidates have already been cracked using unforeseen attacks. Because no remaining candidate ever will have a security guarantee, NIST recommends organizations develop operationally impractical, crypto-agile, hybrid data encryption solutions.

This presentation proposes overlooked, simple, Deterministic Chaos based data encryption methods that fortify and compliment NIST standards against such unforeseen attacks. Standalone, they stalemate all classical, Quantum Computer, and AI/ML mathematical algorithm racking attempts.

These mathematics-free methods provide provably unsurpassed data encryption simplicity, strength, performance, and safety.

The presentation will demonstrate a small, inexpensive, programmable cryptography module using them that encrypts data at approximately 2.5 GBytes/sec. using nearly obsolete cell phone technology.

*David* has 17 issued and pending patents involving a variety of system design and algorithmic methods. He has authored dozens of articles and eleven technical books that explain complex technology in approachable ways. David has developed six commercial software programs in several different languages for multiple machine architectures. He has delivered Usenix™  seminars on Erasure Coding, a subject he has presented several times at leading Silicon Valley conferences and enterprises. He has presented at Stanford, MIT, The Naval Post Graduate School, Google, Sun/Oracle Labs, and Samsung America HQ.

David lectures at Silicon Valley companies such as Oracle/Sun, Intel, and Google, as well as universities such as Stanford, MIT, and the Naval Postgraduate School, immersing audiences in his favorite subject – innovation and its manifold surprises. His October 2007 MIT joint Sloan School of Management and Department of Electrical Engineering conference lecture was selected best in conference.

David has a Masters Degree in Applied Mathematics from the California Institute of Technology and an MBA from the University of Southern California.

Looking forward to your participation.

Thank you.

Please inform the students and ensure they are all assembled in their respective class venues for the AN Session at 1.30pm today
18/06/24, 1:32 pm - HOD Sir: Dear Heads
We have sufficient rooms in hostels

Students need not worry

Definitely they will be given accommodation
18/06/24, 1:32 pm - HOD Sir: Director hostel
18/06/24, 2:15 pm - Dhilipanrajkumar Sir: Spoke with the bus driver, understood that three buses were available in 8th block to pickup the students and only one bus got filled and remaining students had already left the venue for online booking. So drivers have presumed that the strength is only for one bus. So that bus alone went for pickup from hostel. That is the confusion 

From tomorrow, three buses will be available
18/06/24, 6:32 pm - Dhilipanrajkumar Sir: Dear Heads

19/06/24, 6:49 am - Dhilipanrajkumar Sir: Please share the sheet with students and ask them to assemble in their respective venues. We have mentioned FN and AN venues separately in the sheet

19/06/24, 12:10 pm - HOD Sir: Students any queries please contact hostel authorities and help line numbers given.
19/06/24, 12:40 pm - Dhilipanrajkumar Sir: Dear PDs

As mentioned, segregation is based on the assessment conducted last week. Students were categorised as Elite, Moderate and Non Performer. This categorisation is only for this week. Every student will be either stepped up or stepped down or will be retained in same category based on daily assessment scores, weekly assessment (if any), trainer feedback and daily attendance. Batch categorisation will be reviewed once every week.
19/06/24, 12:40 pm - Dhilipanrajkumar Sir: Also, there is a rumour among students that only the elite batch students will be given the opportunity to attend higher package (Super Dream Companies) placement drives. 

Actually, we will provide this opportunity for everyone who meets the company eligibility Criteria. 

But company specific training will be delivered only for the elite batch students. It might not be possible to clear the company test without getting proper training on the company requirements. 

Please motivate the students to utilise this training program to upskill themselves.
19/06/24, 1:04 pm - Dhilipanrajkumar Sir: Companies visiting the campus will be categorised as Regular, Dream and Super Dream Companies based on their CTC offerings. 

Slowly these three levels of students categorisation will help us to identify the suitable pool for each category of companies.

 And only the identified students will get the support and training to face the campus selection process. 

For Eg, Elite batch students will get support (ie. Mock Test, Mock Interviews, Company specific Training (if needed) for all three categories of companies 

Wherein the third category students will get support only for Regular companies.
