      <td>Dear Students, “Slow and steady wins the race” does not apply to AI models. An AI compiler's configurations can change the way it compiles and optimizes the models, making them run faster—or slower.  In this competition, you’ll predict how fast an AI model runs and determine the best configuration for each model.  Total Prizes: $50,000  Entry Deadline: November 10, 2023  https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-ai-model-runtime?utm_medium=email&utm_source=gamma&utm_campaign=comp-tpugraphs-2023   Your work will improve the compiler's heuristic to select the best configuration without human intervention. You’ll help AI models run more efficiently, and consume less time and resources overall.  Good luck,</td>

      <td>The Principal/Dean/Director/Faculty  AICTE Approved institutions  Greetings from AICTE !  As you are already aware that Yuva Sangam is a flagship program of the Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat (EBSB) initiative, launched by the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India. This initiative focuses on conducting exposure tours of the youths comprising mainly students studying in Higher Educational institutions (HEIs) & some off-campus youths from one state to other states & vice versa. It provides an immersive experience of various facets of life, development landmarks, recent achievements and a youth connect in the host state. The program aims to promote national integration and understanding by connecting youth from different parts of the country through educational and cultural exchanges.  In addition to the cultural exchange, Yuva Sangam also includes a number of other activities that are designed to help students develop their leadership, sports and soft skills. For example, students may get an opportunity not only to participate in workshops on leadership, communication, and teamwork but also sports events that may be organised by SAI. They will also have the opportunity to meet and interact with VVIPs, celebrities or important personalities of the host state.  The success of earlier phases of Yuva Sangam are a testament to the importance of investing in youth and building bridges between different communities. The program has had a positive impact on the lives of thousands of youth and has helped to build a more united and inclusive India.  I request your support in motivating students of your institution to register for Yuva Sangam Phase-4, a student exchange program under EBSB.  All interested students can register online at https://ebsb.aicte-india.org/  The registration has started on 25-01-2024 and the last date is 04-02-2024.  Please find attached a document on how to inspire students to register for Yuva Sangam.

We have grouped the sections based on the topic coverage. We will share the assessment name and mapped sections shortly.  Some important points to note: 1) Our platform tracks assessment malpractices and random attempts 2) Basis the above 2 factors, we will be able to flag test-taker's attempt as doubtful 3) Requesting students to avoid opening any other tabs, copy/paste, right-clicking during the assessment 4) Also it is *highly recommended to save the answers after every question*  We wish, all the best!</td>

      <td>IPT/Internship Registration:  We have made few modifications for Internship approval process. This time internship registrations and approvals will be through Zoho Forms. Students whoever willing to go for internship will have to fill out a Zoho form entering their basic details, company and batch student details. Individual Registration is mandatory. In the form, Students must mention only their University Email ID . TPO will verify the company profile and give an approval based up on the verification. Students will get a mail notification about their applications status. If approved, students will receive an annexure along with the mail, which needs to be submitted with their department coordinator along with the company permission letter before they commence the internship. Department will conduct review only for the students who have successfully completed the internship and taken prior approval from the dept and TPO. Coordinators must submit the result passing sheet along with the students company permission letter and internship completion certificate with TPO. Result passing sheet will be signed after completion of document verification.  We have created separate forms for 2025 and 2026 passing out students.  Registration Link  For 2025 passing out students - https://zfrmz.com/UQTPxTR7Ol0aC1yEFT2L  For 2026 passing out students - https://zfrmz.com/2X4TzkLWoRoFb6MiqLg1</td>

      <td>*IEEE R10Talk#5: Fortifying NIST Post Quantum Cryptography Methods on 8 June 2024* Dear All, Greetings from IEEE Region 10! IEEE Region 10 Webinar Series "IEEE R10Talk" is pleased to invite you to its next webinar:- 2024 R10Talk #5: Fortifying NIST Post Quantum Cryptography Methods Against Unforeseen Mathematical Attack  Speaker: *David Schwaderer* | *IEEE Region 6, Northern Nevada Section Chair and CEO of ShapeShift® Ciphers LLC*  *Date: 8 June 2024 (Saturday)*  Time: 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM (UTC +8:00 / Kuala Lumpur, Singapore Time) *IST Time: 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM*  Register at: https://ieeemeetings.webex.com/weblink/register/r93520cc0678a066e822c093f1b875a41  Abstract  The global Internet has begun a formidable migration to NIST PQC methods. Unfortunately, two of NIST's nine initial standardization candidates have already been cracked using unforeseen attacks. Because no remaining candidate ever will have a security guarantee, NIST recommends organizations develop operationally impractical, crypto-agile, hybrid data encryption solutions.  This presentation proposes overlooked, simple, Deterministic Chaos based data encryption methods that fortify and compliment NIST standards against such unforeseen attacks. Standalone, they stalemate all classical, Quantum Computer, and AI/ML mathematical algorithm racking attempts.  These mathematics-free methods provide provably unsurpassed data encryption simplicity, strength, performance, and safety.  The presentation will demonstrate a small, inexpensive, programmable cryptography module using them that encrypts data at approximately 2.5 GBytes/sec. using nearly obsolete cell phone technology.  *David* has 17 issued and pending patents involving a variety of system design and algorithmic methods. He has authored dozens of articles and eleven technical books that explain complex technology in approachable ways. David has developed six commercial software programs in several different languages for multiple machine architectures. He has delivered Usenix™  seminars on Erasure Coding, a subject he has presented several times at leading Silicon Valley conferences and enterprises. He has presented at Stanford, MIT, The Naval Post Graduate School, Google, Sun/Oracle Labs, and Samsung America HQ.  David lectures at Silicon Valley companies such as Oracle/Sun, Intel, and Google, as well as universities such as Stanford, MIT, and the Naval Postgraduate School, immersing audiences in his favorite subject – innovation and its manifold surprises. His October 2007 MIT joint Sloan School of Management and Department of Electrical Engineering conference lecture was selected best in conference.  David has a Masters Degree in Applied Mathematics from the California Institute of Technology and an MBA from the University of Southern California.  Looking forward to your participation.  Thank you.</td>
